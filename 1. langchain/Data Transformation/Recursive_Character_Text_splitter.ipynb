The world’s fastest high-capacity construction hoists, with a speed of up to 2 m/sec (120 metres/min), were used to move men and materials.\\nOver 45,000 cubic metres (1.59 million cubic ft) of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes, \\nwere used to construct the concrete and steel foundations, which feature 192 piles buried more than 50 m (164 ft) deep. \\nBurj Khalifa employs a record-breaking 330,000 cubic m (11.6 million cubic ft) of concrete;  \\n39,000 m/t of reinforced steel; 103,000 sq m (1.1 million sq ft) of glass; 15,500 sq m (166,800 sq ft) of embossed stainless steel; and the tower took 22 million man hours to build. \\nThe amount of reinforced steel used at the tower, would if laid end to end extend over a quarter of the \\nway around the world. The concrete used is equivalent to a sidewalk 1,900 kilometres (1,200 miles) in length, and the weight of 100,000 elephants. The weight of the empty building is 500,000 tonnes. \\nWork on the exterior cladding of Burj Khalifa began in May 2007 and was completed in September \\n2009. The vast project involved more than 380 skilled engineers and on-site technicians. At the initial stage of installation the team progressed at the rate of about 20 to 30 panels per day, before increasing to as many as 175 panels per day.\\nThe tower accomplished a world record for the highest installation of an aluminium and glass \\nfaçade, at a height of 512 metres (1,679.8 ft). The total weight of aluminium used on Burj Khalifa is equivalent to that of five A380 aircraft, and the total length of stainless steel ‘bull nose’ fins is 293 times the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. \\nBurj Khalifa’s high performance exterior cladding system is designed to withstand the UAE’s \\nsummer temperatures. In all, the 24,348 cladding panels cover a curtain wall area of 132,190 sq m, and Burj Khalifa’s shimmering exterior minimises heat transmission and saves energy. \\nIn November 2007, the highest reinforced concrete core-walls were pumped using 80 megapascals \\n(MPa) concrete from ground level. The concrete was pumped to a height of 605 metres  (1,971.8 ft), breaking the previous pumping record held by Taipei 101. The concrete pressure during pumping to this level was nearly 200 bars.\\nSTRUCTURAL ELEMENTS\\nBurj Khalifa pushes the frontiers of engineering, construction and design expertise. Its structure employs the latest advances in wind engineering, structural engineering, structural systems, construction materials and construction methods. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'FACT-SHEET.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='Foundation\\nThe superstructure is supported by a large reinforced concrete mat, which is in turn supported by \\nbored reinforced concrete piles. The mat is 3.7 metres thick, and was constructed in four separate pours totalling 12,500 cubic metres of concrete. \\nPodium\\nThe podium provides a base anchoring the tower to the ground, allowing access from three different sides to three different levels of the building. Fully glazed entry pavilions built with a suspended cable-net structure provide separate entries for the Corporate Suites at B1 and \\nConcourse Levels, the Burj Khalifa residences at Ground Level and the Armani Hotel at Level 1.\\nStructural Core\\nIn addition to its aesthetic and functional advantages, the spiraling “Y” shaped plan was utilised to \\nshape the structural core of Burj Khalifa. This design helps to reduce the wind forces on the tower, as well as to keep the structure simple and enhance ‘constructability’. The structural system can be \\ndescribed as a “buttressed core”, and consists of high-performance concrete wall construction. \\nWind Engineering\\nThe shape of the Burj Khalifa is the result of innovative research by SOM’s architects and engineers \\nto vary the shape of the building along its height, thereby minimising wind forces on the building. Each uniquely-shaped section of the tower causes the wind to behave differently; preventing it \\nfrom becoming ‘organised’ and therefore minimising lateral movement of the structure. \\nHigh-performance, reinforced concrete core walls are linked to the exterior columns through a \\nseries of reinforced concrete shear wall panels at the mechanical levels.  Extensive wind tunnel \\ntesting ensured that the tower design is able to resist high wind loads while minimising vibration.  \\nAs well as wind tunnel studies, the team performed a detailed climatic study which considered the unique meteorological conditions of Dubai. These studies evaluated both frequently occurring and rare wind events to address occupant comfort and building strength.  \\nSpire\\nThe crowning feature of Burj Khalifa is its ‘telescopic’ spire comprising more than 4,000 tonnes of structural steel. It can be seen from 95 km (60 miles) away. The spire was built inside the building and jacked to its full height of over 200 metres (700 feet) using hydraulic strand jacks. The spire \\nis integral to the overall design, creating a sense of completion for the landmark. The spire also \\nhouses communications equipment.\\nMechanical Floors\\nSeven double-storey mechanical floors house the equipment that bring Burj Khalifa to life. Located every 30 storeys, the mechanical floors house the electrical sub-stations, water tanks and pumps,  \\nair-handling units etc, that are essential for the operation of the tower and the comfort of its occupants.\\nBroadcast and Communications Floors\\nThe top four floors have been reserved for communications and broadcasting. These floors occupy the levels just below the spire.'),\n",

The building service/fireman’s elevator has a capacity of 5,500 kg and is the world’s tallest service elevator.\\nBurj Khalifa is the first ‘mega-high rise’ building in which certain elevators are programmed to permit \\ncontrolled evacuation for certain fire or security events. Burj Khalifa’s observatory elevators are double deck cabs with a capacity for 12 to 14 people per cab.

This water is collected and drained in a separate piping system to a holding tank in the basement car park. The condensate collection system provides about 15 million gallons of supplement water per year, equal to about 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The tower’s peak \\nelectrical demand is 36mW, equal to about 360,000 bulbs of 100 watts operating simultaneously.\\nWindow Washing Bays\\nAccess to the tower’s exterior for both window washing and façade maintenance is provided by \\n18 permanently installed track and fixed-telescopic, cradle-equipped building maintenance units. The track-mounted units are stored in garages, within the structure, and are not visible when not \\nin use. The manned cradles are capable of accessing the entire facade from the top of the tower \\ndown to level seven. Window washing is done vertically from the top to the ground and it takes approximately four months to clean the whole exterior. \\nFire Safety & Security \\nFire safety and speed of evacuation were prime consideration in the design of Burj Khalifa.
