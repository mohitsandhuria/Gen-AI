every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:Development: Build your applications using LangChain\\'s open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations.\\nUse LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.Deployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Cloud.Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:langchain-core: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.langchain-community: Third party integrations.Partner packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on langchain-core.langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application\\'s cognitive architecture.LangGraph: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.LangServe: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.noteThese docs focus on the Python LangChain library.
