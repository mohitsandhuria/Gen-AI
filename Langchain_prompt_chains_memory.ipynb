              "\", in a faraway kingdom, there lived a young princess named Aurora. She was known for her beauty, kindness, and love for all living creatures. Aurora spent her days exploring the lush gardens of the palace and playing with the woodland animals that lived nearby.\\n\\nOne day, while wandering through the forest, Aurora stumbled upon a hidden cottage deep in the woods. Inside, she found three elderly women who were surprised to see her. They revealed themselves to be fairies who had been living in hiding for many years.\\n\\nThe fairies told Aurora that an evil sorceress had placed a curse on the kingdom, causing darkness to fall over the land. The only way to break the curse was for Aurora to find true love and awaken her inner strength.\\n\\nDetermined to save her kingdom, Aurora set out on a quest to find her true love. Along the way, she faced many challenges and obstacles, but with the help of her animal friends and the guidance of the fairies, she persevered.\\n\\nFinally, after many trials and tribulations, Aurora found her true love in a brave prince who had been searching for her all along. With a true love's kiss, the curse was broken, and light returned to the kingdom once more.\\n\\nAurora and her prince were married in a grand ceremony, and they ruled the kingdom together with wisdom and compassion. And they lived happily ever after, their love shining bright for all to see.\""

The city stands on the Moskva River in Central Russia, with a population estimated at 13.0 million residents within the city limits, over 18.8 million residents in the urban area, and over 21.5 million residents in the metropolitan area. The city covers an area of 2,511 square kilometers (970 sq mi), while the urban area covers 5,891 square kilometers (2,275 sq mi), and the metropolitan area covers over 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 sq mi). Moscow is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city in its entirety in Europe, the largest urban and metropolitan area in Europe, and the largest city by land area on the European continent.\n",
            "First documented in 1147, Moscow grew to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. When the Tsardom of Russia was proclaimed, Moscow remained the political and economic center for most of its history. Under the reign of Peter the Great, the Russian capital was moved to the newly founded city of Saint Petersburg in 1712, decreasing Moscow's influence. Following the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Russian SFSR, the capital was moved back to Moscow in 1918, where it later became the political center of the Soviet Union. In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moscow remained the capital city of the newly established Russian Federation.\n",

As an alpha world city, Moscow has one of the world's largest urban economies. The city is one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the world and is one of Europe's most visited cities. Moscow is inhabited by the sixth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world. The Moscow International Business Center is one of the largest financial centers in Europe and the world and features the majority of Europe's tallest skyscrapers. Moscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics and one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n",
            "Moscow is the home of multiple Russian artists, scientists, and sports figures, along with  museums, academic and political institutions, and theaters. The city contains several UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is known for its display of Russian architecture, particularly in areas such as the Red Square and buildings such as the Saint Basil's Cathedral and the Moscow Kremlin, the latter of which is the seat of power of the Government of Russia. Moscow is home to Russian companies in different industries and is served by a comprehensive transit network, which includes four international airports, ten railway terminals, a tram system, a monorail system, and the Moscow Metro, which is the busiest metro system in Europe and one of the largest rapid transit systems in the world. The city has over 40 percent of its territory covered by greenery, making it one of the greenest cities in the world.\n",
